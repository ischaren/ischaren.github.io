<h3>| INTEGRETIVE STUDIES PORTFOLIO</h3><br>
<h2>design, build, and the enviroment</h2><br>
The goal of this major is to provide an adaptive base of skills and knowledge to effectively participate in addressing unforeseeable challenges of the near future through design.  By combining diverse classroom learning with field application, I hope to gain not only the technical skills necessary for engineering intuitive solutions to complex problems, but also the critical thinking skills to think abstractly about the implications and context for design.<br> 
I will study mathematics to understand physics, physics as a means for engineering, computer science to speak the language of technological development, art as philosophy to inform design, and, environmental studies to better understand the relationship between human activities and the environmental systems we participate in.<br>
<h2>guiding questions</h2><br>
How can advancements in technology serve the planet and society?<br>
What are the implications of the increasing presence of the built environment over the natural environment?<br>
How can cooperative interdisciplinary work be effective?<br>
How is design thinking influenced by moral and ethical questions?<br>
What are my actual guiding questions?<br>
