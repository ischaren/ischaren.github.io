<h2>Design, Expression, and Socio-Enviromental Considerations</h2><br>
Design is the construction of human experience.  It is a way of thinking and a method for problem solving.<br>

Art is an expression of human experience.  It is a language of culture that enables communication of ideas beyond words.<br>

Engineering is technical logistics of solution execution. It is the means by which solutions gain physicality.<br>

Engineering and art are distinct from design, yet integral to its successful execution.<br>

Human experience is relationship with ourselves, the natural world, and the built environment.<br>

It is necessary to consider environmental, sociological, and precedent factors in the construction of human experience.<br>

An integrative study of design, therefore, can justifiably span the disciplines of Studio Art, Engineering, Environmental Studies and Sociology in addition to applications of design thinking.<br>

This is the basis for my integrative major, “Design, Build and Socio-Environmental Considerations.”<br>
<h2>Guiding Questions</h2><br>
How can advancements in technology serve the planet and society?<br>
What are the implications of the increasing presence of the built environment over the natural environment?<br>
How can cooperative interdisciplinary work be effective?<br>
How is design thinking influenced by moral and ethical questions?<br>
What are my actual guiding questions?<br>
